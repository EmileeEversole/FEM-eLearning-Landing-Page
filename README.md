### What I learned

I really liked this project! It gave me a lot more confidence regarding building responsive pages and thinking ahead when it comes to design. This was also my first premium challenge and my first time working with Figma. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it, but I think I like it! 

### Continued development

I had the mobile design down pretty easily, and found that it was a lot easier to design mobile-first with Figma. However, I stumbled a bit when it came to getting the tablet/desktop layout situated. I did some of the styling (fonts, colors, etc) first, which actually really helped when it came time to work on the layout, so I think I will continue to try doing it that way!
